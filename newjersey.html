    <p>"Right here, between New York and Philadelphia, lie many hundreds of miles of wilderness, almost as free from civilizing touch as a wildest parts of the wild West."

    <p>"Fine wines, outstanding restaurants, classic jazz festivals and special events year 'round. Some things just get better with age, and charming Cape May is no exception. This historic Victorian seaside gem is the oldest resort and one of the most beautiful spots in the country. The entire city is a National Historic District, with nearly 600 preserved Victorian buildings."</p>

    <p>Jersey's scenic byways are a great way to travel from one spot to the next. They're often a great way to get down to the shore, and you can stop at farms and diners along the way for fresh fruit or a plate of pancakes.</p>
